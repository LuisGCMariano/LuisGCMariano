Hello,

My name is Luís Mariano
and I'm currently studying
Economics at UBI, in Portugal.

I'm currently on a path to
gather knowledge and delve into
Data Science, and, as such, 
I'm going to be using 
this GitHub page to organize
and expose my way of learning.

Looking forward to meeting
new people and participating
in interesting projects

Hope you have a good time
browsing through my files.

Best Regards,
Luís Mariano
