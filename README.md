Hello,

My name is Luís Mariano
and I'm currently studying
Economics at UBI, in Portugal.

I'm currently on a path to
gather knowledge and delve into
Data Science, and, as such, 
I'm going to be using 
this GitHub page to organize
and expose some of my projects.


Hope you have a good time
browsing through my files.

Best Regards,
Luís Mariano

Skills: 
  Python
    Experienced in most data analysis
      and data vizualization modules,
      and in all the usual mathematics modules)
    
  R 
    Programmed in R during my course of 
    "Econometrics I" (see below) 
    
  EViews
    Programmed in Eviews during my course of 
    "Econometrics I" and "Econometrics II" ("")
    

Courses:
  Econometrics I
    - Simple and multiple regressions where taught.
      Following this teaching, we studied the how to
      interpret and treat problems associated with the
      violation of the CLRM assumptions using Cross-
      -Sectional Data.
    - Practical appliance of the theoretical topics 
      learned through programming in R and using the 
      statistical program EViews

Econometrics II
  - Following the topics learned in "Ecoonometrics I"
    in this class we studied the topics of autocorrelation,
    distributed lag models, univariate stationarity and non-
    -stationary models (UR tests and ARMA/ARIMA) models,
    models of conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH/GARCH/...),
    stationary and non-stationary multivariate models (VAR,
    Granger Causality and Cointegration and VECM (Johansen Method).
  - Practical appliance of the theoretical topics learned
    through programming in the statistical program EViews.
